## Energy Overview
Exploration, extraction, generation, distribution, and consumption of various forms of energy to power societies and fuel economic activities. It encompasses both traditional and renewable energy sources, including fossil fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal, as well as renewable sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy. 

### Business Cases

- **Traditional energy companies** managing exploration, production, and optimization of oil and gas reserves.  
- **Renewable energy developers** building and operating solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power infrastructure.  
- **Energy storage startups** pioneering battery technologies and efficient energy retention systems.  
- **Smart grid providers** optimizing distribution networks through automation, real-time data, and predictive maintenance.

Additionally, the industry addresses: **environmental sustainability**, **regulatory compliance**, and the broader **transition toward decarbonization** and cleaner energy alternatives.
